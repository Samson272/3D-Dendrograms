# 3D-Dendrograms
An extension to the dendrogram algorithm for analysing 3D Data. This file is built on the code first written by Dario Colombo in 2016. Colombo's original is available here: https://github.com/dendrograms/astrodendro/pull/147/files.
This project will later be merged with the complete Astrodendro package.
